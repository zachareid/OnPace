OnPace is a fitness app made for the Garmin ConnectIQ Store. It's built to help runners stay within a pace range on a given run. If the runner deviates outside of their pace range, the built-in vibration module will gently nudge them to speed up or slow down.

<h1>HOW TO USE:</h1>

Set a minutes per mile pace range for yourself. Your watch will vibrate rapidly if you need to pick up your pace and vibrate slowly if you need to hit the brakes.

Select your pace by using the "UP" and "DOWN" keys and hit the "ENTER" key to advance to the next parameter (Touch response available on vivoactive). Then select a radius for the range of your pace and hit "ENTER". Once you have entered your pace and pace range, press the "ENTER" key to begin your exercise.

The app will wait until you reach your pace to start the vibration reminders. You can hit the "UP" key to toggle between data screens that show your Current Pace and Desired Pace versus your Activity Time and Distance Traveled(Tap the screen to toggle screens on the vivoactive). Once you have finished your activity, press the "ENTER" key and bring up the Save Screen. If you'd like to save your exercise, press the "ENTER" key, and to discard, press the "BACK" key.
